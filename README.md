# Seller_Dashboard

### In this project , I made the dummy of seller dashboard in with they can create their products on their personal dashboards only by using nodeJs and its expressJs framework.

### For authentication , I have used the jwt Authentication like I wrote the code for jwt sign at the time of registration and verify the token at the time of token verification as login .

### In that without using params they can update their personal profile only because I have store their name on cookies .

###For looking the homepage , I have used mongoDB populate query .
